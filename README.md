### Playit Branding Guidelines

You are welcome to use Playit logos and branding assets in your projects, articles, videos, or tools as long as your use does not mislead people about your relationship with Playit.

* **No implied endorsement** – Do not state or suggest that your project, product, or service is officially endorsed, certified, sponsored, or maintained by Playit unless you have explicit written approval from us.
* **Clear attribution** – If you use the Playit name or logo, make it clear whether your project is independent or affiliated. For example, say "for Playit" or "compatible with Playit," not "official Playit."
* **No modification of marks** – Do not alter the Playit logos, colors, or typography beyond resizing. If you need variations (e.g., dark/light backgrounds), please use the provided versions.
* Respect our brand – Don’t use our branding in a way that could be considered offensive, misleading, or damaging to the Playit reputation.
* **Naming** – You may not name your project "Playit" or use confusingly similar names. Instead, use phrasing like "XYZ Plugin using Playit."
* **Redistribution** – You may re-host or redistribute our logos as part of your project, but only in compliance with these terms.

### Remix & Community Contributions

We know that sometimes you may want a variation of our logo (for dark/light backgrounds, small sizes, or fun community uses). Please don’t distribute altered versions on your own. Instead, feel free to:

* **Submit a remix** as a pull request to this repository.
* Clearly label it as a remix or variation so we can review.
* If approved, we’ll add it as an official alternative asset for the whole community to use.

This way, everyone benefits from consistent, high-quality assets, and creative contributions can become part of the official Playit brand kit.
